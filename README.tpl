## Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV)

The minimum supported Rust version is **Rust 1.56.1**.
At least the last 3 versions of stable Rust are supported at any given time.

While a crate is pre-release status (0.x.x) it may have its MSRV bumped in a patch release.
Once a crate has reached 1.x, any MSRV bump will be accompanied with a new minor version.
